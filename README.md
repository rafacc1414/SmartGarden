# SmartGarden
SmartGarden is an IoT-based project designed to automate the monitoring and watering of plants in a garden. It uses various sensors to track environmental conditions such as soil moisture, light intensity, temperature, and humidity, and automatically controls a water pump to ensure plants receive the right amount of water.
